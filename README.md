# Biomedical Image Processing using MATLAB

This project explores multiple core techniques in digital biomedical image processing using MATLAB, including contrast enhancement, denoising, edge detection, image segmentation, and image registration. The work emphasizes real-world medical applications like CT, MRI, and cellular imaging.

## 📄 Project Overview

- **Title:** Biomedical Image Processing & Analysis
- **Field:** Biomedical Engineering, Image Processing
- **Tools Used:** MATLAB, ImageJ
- **Author:** Ayman Zafar
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Khawza Iftekhar Uddin Ahmed

## 🧠 Techniques Covered

### 🔹 1. Contrast Enhancement
- Mapping intensity to brightness
- Gamma correction: adjusting perception of dark/light regions

### 🔹 2. Denoising
- Gaussian noise simulation
- Median filtering and windowed averaging
- Fourier transform-based analysis

### 🔹 3. Edge Detection
- Gradient-based edge detection (Sobel, circshift, magnitude)
- Binary mask creation and morphological processing

### 🔹 4. Image Segmentation
- Intensity-based segmentation of medical scans
- Mask creation, flood-fill region growing, and visualization

### 🔹 5. Image Registration
- Aligning multiple images using Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD)
- Transform analysis for alignment optimization
